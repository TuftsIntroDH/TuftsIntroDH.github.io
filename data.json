            "National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP)\n\n  \n  News room of the New York Times newspaper, 1942.\n\nThe digitized newspapers available in Chronicling America are produced through the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP), a partnership between the National Endowment\n    for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LC). NDNP is a long-term effort to provide permanent\n  access to a national digital resource of historic newspapers, selected and digitized by NEH-funded institutions\n  (awardees) from all U.S. states and territories. This program builds on the legacy of the strategically successful United States Newspaper Program (USNP, 1982-2011), a project\n  sponsored by the NEH with technical support from LC which organized the inventory, cataloging, and selective\n  preservation on microfilm of a corpus of at-risk newspaper materials."
