# What we do when we do DH

cf. [What We Teach When We Teach DH](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/projects/what-we-teach-when-we-teach-dh)

## Digital Dante

https://dante.dartmouth.edu

How does this resource compare to something like Perseus?

## Pop DH?

Is https://genius.com a digital humanities project? Why or why not?

## What counts as a DH project?

- Look for a few digital humanities projects on your own — consider the breadth of projects that we have covered this semester.
- Write a few thoughts about how each of them engages with the digital and with humanistic inquiry.

## Your turn

Start thinking about your final projects. You might want to write a Programming Historian–style lesson. What kind of topic would you like to cover? What materials will you need to prepare to share with your potential readers?

Or you might choose to do a GIS project, or to finish encoding a portion of a text from the rare books collection.

In each case, consider what materials you will need to gather over the next week so that you can have a productive time working in class.

Please make time to discuss your plans with Charles no later than Friday, April 18.
